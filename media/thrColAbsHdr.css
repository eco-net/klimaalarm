/* Tips for absolutely positioned sidebars with header and footer:
1. Absolutely positioned (AP) elements must be given a top and side value, either right or left. (As a default, if no top value is given, the AP element will begin directly after the last element in the source order of the page. This means, if the sidebars are first element in the #container in the document&quot;s source order, they will appear at the top of the #container even without being given a top value. However, if they are moved later in the source order for any reason, they&quot;ll need a top value to appear where you desire.
2. Absolutely positioned (AP) elements are taken out of the flow of the document. This means the elements around them don&quot;t know they exist and don&quot;t account for them when taking up their proper space on the page. Thus, an AP div should only be used as a side column if you are sure the middle #mainContent div will always contain the most content. If either sidebar were to contain more content, that sidebar would run over the bottom of the parent div, and in this case the footer as well, and the sidebar would not appear to be contained.
3. If the above mentioned requirements are met, absolutely positioned sidebars can be an easy way to control the source order of the document.
4. If the source order is changed, the top value should be equal to the height of the header since this will cause the columns to visually meet the header.
